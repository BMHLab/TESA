# TESA
The TMS-EEG signal analyser (TESA) is an open source extension for [EEGLAB](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) that includes functions necessary for cleaning and analysing TMS-EEG data. Both EEGLAB and TESA run in [Matlab](http://au.mathworks.com/) (r2015b or later). 

The current release is a beta version and is still undergoing testing.
